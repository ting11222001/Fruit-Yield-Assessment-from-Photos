## What I’m going to make and Why I’m doing it
I always have an idea about how to help farmers have more efficiency in counting their yields. Isn’t it awesome if they can take a quick glimpse of their orchards and then “ding!” get the answer right away? Maybe one day this quick application could be helpful to farmers like when they need to plan for hiring workers to collect fruits, or this could be helpful to the government officials that they can collect field pictures to assess a season’s yield of a certain fruit to monitor the potential amount in the market ahead of time.

## Environment and Skills used in this project
I'm using Python3 and Scikit-Learn (skimage.feature) to train the image recognition model, make it recognize the rest of unclicked mangoes on a picture. These codes were run in anaconda.

## Notes for files
* matching_ripen_mangoes_all.py: main codes which were used in anaconda environment
